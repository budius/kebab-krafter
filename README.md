## About

Kebab-Krafter is a gradle plugin to auto-generate network interfaces from a set of swagger API documentation.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To start using the plugin just add to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
id("com.diconium.mobile.tools.kebab-krafter") version "latest_version"
```

### Generate Ktor Server

Just add the configuration to your gradle script

```kotlin

ktorServer {

	// Root package name for the generated code
	packageName = "root.package.name.for.the.generated.code"

	// file system location for the swagger spec
	specFile = File(rootDir, "swagger/api.yml")

	// definition for the receiver class for the API controllers
	contextSpec {
		packageName = "com.myserver.api"
		className = "CallScope"
		factoryName = "from"
	}
}
```

and with that you can execute `./gradlew generateKtorServer` to auto-genearted a `Route.installGeneratedRoutes`, all the `data classes` using `kotlinx-serialization` and the interfaces for each endpoint in the following format:

```Kotlin
public interface GetPathName {
    public fun CallScope.execute(pathParameters, queryParameters, body) : ResponseBody
}
```

From that you just have to implement the interfaces!

#### The contextSpec

The `contextSpec` is a "joker-card" to extract any metadata needed from the `Ktor.ApplicationCall` before passing to the controller. In the sample app you can see it extracting the `accept-language` header into a `Locale` object.

In the snippet above the context was named `CallScope` in the package `com.myserver.api`, a simple example for it would be:

```Kotlin
interface CallScope {
    val locale: Locale // define meta-data your controller needs from the request

    companion object {

        // define a factory function to create the object
        fun from(call: ApplicationCall): CallScope = CallScopeImpl(call)
    }
}
```

Making this context an interface is advisable, so that it's trivial to unit test the controller by creating a `FakeContext()`

```Kotlin
// implement the real object separetely, to make it trivial to implement unit tests.
private class CallScopeImpl(private val call: ApplicationCall) : CallScope {
    override val locale: Locale by lazy {
        call.request.acceptLanguage().toLocale()
    }
}
```

#### The ServiceLocator

The generated `installGeneratedRoutes` receives a object of type `ServiceLocator` located in the same package of the `installGeneratedRoutes`.

The `ServiceLocator` is a very simple `get<T>` interface that can be adapted to any dependency injection you want to use. For example using Koin it would be something like:

```kotlin
class KoinServiceLocator(private val koin: Koin) : ServiceLocator {
	override fun <T : Any> getService(type: KClass<T>): T = koin.get(type)
}
```

### Further Examples

Check the `sample/` app with the "Pet Store" for a full example.
